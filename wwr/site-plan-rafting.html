    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

    <h2>White Water Rafting Safety Procedures</h2>
    <p>White water rafting may be a super fun awesome activity! But it still has times where it is dangerous and can be deadly.</p>
    <p>Because of that we want to ensure that everyone knows what safety procedures we have</p>
    <p>Competent swimmer: Be a confident swimmer or at least comfortable in the water.</p>
    <p>Life jacket and helmet: Wear a properly fitted, Coast Guard-approved life jacket and a helmet at all times.</p>
    <p>Clothing and footwear: Wear quick-drying, moisture-wicking clothing and secure, closed-toe shoes that won't easily come off.</p>
    <p>Sun protection: Use sunscreen, sunglasses, and potentially a hat to protect from the sun.</p>

    <p>With these bits of advice your trip white water rafting will be a safer and more enjoyable journey than ever before!</p>
