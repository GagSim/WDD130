Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->

    <h2>Chili</h2>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <p>1 pound ground beef</p>
    <p>1 onion diced</p>
    <p>1 jalapeño seeded and finely diced</p>

<img src="pictures/Hamburger1.png" alt="Yum yum yum">
<h2>Hamburger</h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p>Beef: These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean ground beef. </p>
<p>Onion: A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch. </p>
<p>Cheese: You will need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese. </p>
<p>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties together. </p>
<p>Seasonings, herbs, and sauces: These hamburgers are flavored with an envelope of dry onion soup mix, fresh garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, dried parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, crushed dried rosemary, salt, and pepper.</p>
<h2>How to make</h2>
<p>Combine the ingredients in a bowl.</p>
<p>Make four patties.</p> 
<p>Grill the patties until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink in the center.</p>

<h2>Sushi</h2>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p>1/2 lb Imitation crab meat (p.s. the “log” shaped crab meat is the easiest to work with)</p>
<p>1 Avocado, ripe but still firm</p>
<p>1/2 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced into long julienne strips</p>
<p>Toasted Nori Seaweed</p>
<p>Toasted sesame seeds</p>
<p>A sushi rolling mat + Plastic wrap to cover the mat. If you don’t have a sushi mat, try using parchment paper instead.</p>
<p>And any sauce of your choice, my personal favorites are soy sauce, and siracha but use whatever you would like to use.</p>
<h2>How to make</h2>
<p>Wash 2 cups of rice and put into a rice cooker with 2 1/2 cups of water and cook</p>
<p>When your rice is finished cooking, make sure to break up the clumps in your rice cooker.</p>
<p>Optional: If you would like you can add a bit of vinegar to the rice to help it mold into shape and add some flavor you can. If you do, your rice should be warm, but not hot.</p>
<p>Roast your sesame seeds over medium heat until golden brown and make sure to slice your veggies and crab meat into thin but long strips</p>
<p>Grab your sushi mat and cover it in plastic wrap</p>
<p>Spread a generous handful of sushi rice onto the 1/2 sheet of nori. Use your WET FINGER TIPS (keep your hands wet to prevent sticking) to spread the rice evenly over the entire surface of the nori.</p>
<p>Flip the rice covered piece of nori over so the rice is facing down (this way, your rice will be on the outside). Place your fillings across the center of your nori lengthwise (don’t overfill or the roll won’t seal).</p>
<p>Start rolling using your matt to firmly keep the roll in place. Apply some pressure to make a tight roll. If its not tight enough, it will be difficult to cut. Once the roll is complete, sprinkle the roll with toasted sesame seeds while it is still on the mat so you can turn it easily.</p>
<p>Run your sharp knife through a damp paper towel before slicing so the rice won’t stick as much. Cut the roll in half, then line the two halves up and slice into even 1-inch rings. I have found that it slices easier when you slice quickly.</p>
