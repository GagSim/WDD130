            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>You will need:</p>
            <p>1/2 lb Imitation crab meat (p.s. the “log” shaped crab meat is the easiest to work with)</p>
            <p>1 Avocado, ripe but still firm</p>
            <p>1/2 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced into long julienne strips</p>
            <p>Toasted Nori Seaweed</p>
            <p>Toasted sesame seeds</p>
            <p>A sushi rolling mat + Plastic wrap to cover the mat. If you don’t have a sushi mat, try using parchment paper instead.</p>
            <p>And any sauce of your choice, my personal favorites are soy sauce, and siracha but use whatever you would like to use.</p>
            <h2>How to make</h2>
            <p>Wash 2 cups of rice and put into a rice cooker with 2 1/2 cups of water and cook</p>
            <p>When your rice is finished cooking, make sure to break up the clumps in your rice cooker.</p>
            <p>Optional: If you would like you can add a bit of vinegar to the rice to help it mold into shape and add some flavor you can. If you do, your rice should be warm, but not hot.</p>
            <p>Roast your sesame seeds over medium heat until golden brown and make sure to slice your veggies and crab meat into thin but long strips</p>
            <p>Grab your sushi mat and cover it in plastic wrap</p>
            <p>Spread a generous handful of sushi rice onto the 1/2 sheet of nori. Use your WET FINGER TIPS (keep your hands wet to prevent sticking) to spread the rice evenly over the entire surface of the nori.</p>
            <p>Flip the rice covered piece of nori over so the rice is facing down (this way, your rice will be on the outside). Place your fillings across the center of your nori lengthwise (don’t overfill or the roll won’t seal).</p>
            <p>Start rolling using your matt to firmly keep the roll in place. Apply some pressure to make a tight roll. If its not tight enough, it will be difficult to cut. Once the roll is complete, sprinkle the roll with toasted sesame seeds while it is still on the mat so you can turn it easily.</p>
            <p>Run your sharp knife through a damp paper towel before slicing so the rice won’t stick as much. Cut the roll in half, then line the two halves up and slice into even 1-inch rings. I have found that it slices easier when you slice quickly.</p>
